 # Covid-Screening-App
 In the Side project I tried to practice Restful API, JDBC, Database, spring, Vue.js, 
 java Script is a very simple way. Restful API call will search user id inside the database and  
 give you the user name and access for next page. 

# Step One 
Create a database named "employee" in pgAdmin; username : postgres; password: postgres1;

# Step Two 
Connect the database "employee" with DBVisualizer and run "employeedetails.sql" script
inside the java>Database folder

# Step three 
run the SpringBoot Application with IDE and start back end Server

# Step four
run vue and start the server

# Step five
use the user Id from database to log in
